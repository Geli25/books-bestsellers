    "full_description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the National Book Award–winning author of Stamped from the Beginning comes a “groundbreaking” ( Time ) approach to understanding and uprooting racism and inequality in our society—and in ourselves. “The most courageous book to date on the problem of race in the Western mind.”— The New York Times NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • Time • NPR • The Washington Post • Shelf Awareness • Library Journal • Publishers Weekly • Kirkus Reviews Antiracism is a transformative concept that reorients and reenergizes the conversation about racism—and, even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist , Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas—from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities—that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves. Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society. Praise for How to Be an Antiracist “Ibram X. Kendi’s new book, How to Be an Antiracist , couldn’t come at a better time. . . . Kendi has gifted us with a book that is not only an essential instruction manual but also a memoir of the author’s own path from anti-black racism to anti-white racism and, finally, to antiracism. . . . How to Be an Antiracist gives us a clear and compelling way to approach, as Kendi puts it in his introduction, ‘the basic struggle we’re all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.’ ” —NPR “Kendi dissects why in a society where so few people consider themselves to be racist the divisions and inequalities of racism remain so prevalent. How to Be an Antiracist punctures the myths of a post-racial America, examining what racism really is—and what we should do about it.” — Time",

        "review_text": "Enlightening even for the supposedly enlightened... I am White. I am an immigrant. My family came to this country when I was 6 years old, by far the youngest. I learned English fluently; while you would hear the accent of my older relatives to this day, you would not know that I was not born here, that English was not my first language. I grew up on the idea of the Great American Melting Pot. Throughout my childhood and teen years, I was always seen as the person from the country of my origin. It wasn't until my college years that I was relieved to finally be seen as simply American, from California rather than from my country of origin. The Great American Melting Pot with its goal of assimilation made a lot of sense to me. We kept our family traditions, brought with us from the Old Country, at home. But outwardly, I wanted to fit in, to be simply American. It also made sense from an historical perspective. There was a time when Italians, Irish, Germans, and others fresh off the (literal) boat were seen as unwelcome newcomers, much as many from south of our border are sadly seen today. These European groups needed to assimilate. Imagine if Italian-Americans and German-Americans in this country had been seen as the enemy come World War II. Americans never could have come together to fight Hitler's armies or Japanese forces in the Pacific. But you may note that I've only mentioned the assimilation of white people from Western Europe. People from China and Japan also faced persecution when they first arrived here (as no doubt did many others). The internment camps created during World War II for those of Japanese descent living in this country were a disgrace. (Please read They Called Us Enemy by George Takei.) To mention nothing of the Black or Hispanic experience of being American in this country. What hit me hardest about this incredible book is largely summed by by the following paragraph: “Assimilationist ideas and segregationist ideas are the two types of racist ideas, the duel within racist thought. White assimilationist ideas challenge segregationist ideas that claim people of color are incapable of development, incapable of reaching the superior standard, incapable of becoming White and therefore fully human. Assimilationists believe that people of color can, in fact, be developed, become fully human, just like White people. Assimilationist ideas reduce people of color to the level of children needing instruction on how to act. Segregationist ideas cast people of color as “animals,” to use Trump's descriptor for Latinx immigrants—unteachable after a point. The history of the racialized world is a three-way fight between assimilationists, segregationists, and antiracists. Antiracist ideas are based in the truth that racial groups are equals in all the ways they are different, assimilationist ideas are rooted in the notion that certain racial groups are culturally or behaviorally inferior, and segregationist ideas spring from a belief in genetic racial distinction and fixed hierarchy.” I have always fancied myself to be not racist. But I can see that I have a long way to go: from assimilationist to antiracist. Even my assimilationist ideas were clearly not well thought out. Read this book. It's eyeopening, even for those of us who consider ourselves to be enlightened. Well written. Extensively researched, with a good deal of history, including personal and family history. Extensively footnoted. Highly readable.",

        "review_text": "How To Be An Antiracist is a confusing, frustrating book that fails to make a convincing case that \"antiracism\" is the best, or even a good way to fight back against racism. It's as if Kendi was given free reign to write whatever he wanted, and no editor ever pushed back to ask questions like \"does the definition you're proposing make sense\" or \"do you have any evidence to support your claim?\" For example, Kendi starts out each chapter by defining a word like \"racist\" or \"success,\" supposedly in an effort to clarify things. But these definitions end up being more confusing than clarifying. Kendi's definition of racist is, \"One who is supporting a racist policy through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea.\" He uses the word \"racist\" twice to define the word \"racist.\" Similarly, the central idea of antiracism seems to be that all racial groups are equal, and therefore, any inequality is proof of racism, and any policy that arguably contributed to that inequality is also racist. This too, does not make sense. If inequality is due to racism, how can we explain inequality within racial groups? Why do white people in one state make more money than in another state? Why do chlidren from two parent households generally do better academically than children from single parent households of the same race? Racism can't be the answer. And Kendi rarely offers any proof that racism is the primary source of inequality between groups, let alone the only source. The book also feels overly long and highly repetitive, with Kendi driving home the same handful of points/ideas over and over again. Racism is a real problem that requires legitimate, evidence-based solutions. How To Be An Antiracist is not that. It is a half-baked philosophy that many other black academics like John McWhorter have effectively picked apart. This book will undoubtedly earn plenty of praise from other self-described \"antiracists\" and white people who wouldn't dare say a critical word about a book about racism written by a black man, but the book is not convincing, nor intellectually rigorous. If you're looking for a guide to fighting against racism, look elsewhere.",

    "full_description": "The New York Times best-selling book exploring the counterproductive reactions white people have when their assumptions about race are challenged, and how these reactions maintain racial inequality. In this “vital, necessary, and beautiful book” (Michael Eric Dyson), antiracist educator Robin DiAngelo deftly illuminates the phenomenon of white fragility and “allows us to understand racism as a practice not restricted to ‘bad people’ (Claudia Rankine). Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what we can do to engage more constructively.

        "review_text": "I am very reluctant to give a negative review, especially when the author is trying to be helpful. In places the author has correctly diagnosed a number of genuine problems. Merely being non-racist isn’t good enough, because you end up as a bystander when a bully is beating up on a victim; both covering your eyes and ears and refusing to acknowledge what the victim (of racism) is telling you is happening to them. If you haven’t been a victim you cannot fully understand being a victim. If you haven’t experienced the pervasiveness and constancy of negative bias both coming from other groups and even influencing your own view of yourself – then you will never completely comprehend. So in one respect a white person cannot truly say, “I get it.” Neither can you ever do enough to win a gold star and say you’ve done “enough” as long as racism exists. It’s like the Talmudic maxim: “you will never finish perfecting the world, but you are never free to stop trying.” If the book stopped there, it would be fine. Perhaps even excellent. But I give this book one star because it makes the problem worse. This book is like a bad date where the other person is accusing you of all of your failures, and when you try to make up, to do better, to understand more, to be fully engaged as an ally, you are continually pushed away. And then you are told to “breathe” and calm down. Surely you are getting upset and proving the thesis! Except that’s not what’s happening. Yes, whites don’t see racism because they aren’t a target of it. If you aren’t a racist, then you don’t hang around racists. And if you aren’t black then you don’t have it hurled in your face. 99% of the problem is created by 1% of whites who other whites don’t see. The same would be true for misogyny. 99% of rapes are caused by 1% of perps, and the 99% of innocent men don’t see it because the perps aren’t harassing them. So men need to listen without being defensive. Whites need to listen without being defensive. It’s wrong to say, “But I’m not doing it” as if that will make it go away. But it’s also wrong to say that the non-harassing men or the non-harassing whites are guilty BECAUSE of their innocence. No, they aren’t being bad. They are being clueless. And instead of being accused they need to be engaged. Especially when they WANT to listen and be helpful. In short, if someone wants to be your friend – let them. This book doesn’t invite engagement and doesn’t let the non-involved to become involved in affirmatively fighting racism. It turns a lot of would be allies away. Ultimately, it’s self defeating. We need more people aware of racism. We need more people fighting racism. We need the majority engaged in helping the minority, rather than being turned away. I’d give this book five stars if it were half as long. But it’s the flawed existentialism that makes this book a hindrance to people who should be friends, and would be friends, if they were allowed to be.",

It is curious that somehow denigrating a person by their skin color is not racist when done by a person of the same appearance. It is a popular book for those that need more of a reason to feel bad about themselves. Ironically, the subject is timely and through reading other sources of information on institutionalized racism, I have noticed many examples of this. The articles were well written and effective in that I was not made to feel that anything I did or said was automatically suspect and therefore invalid.

        "review_text": "Well, first of all, my opinion is that when it comes to \"why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism\", it might have something to do with the fact that this author starts off the \"conversation\" looking for a fight. After reading a little bit, I think she might be trying to make whites uncomfortable as Eduardo Bonilla-Silva did in \"Racism Without Racists\", but she really doesn't do it in any sort of constructive or helpful manner--really just a jerky, I'm smarter than you sort of way--the kind of way that we're taught NOT to do when we are trying to resolve issues--like the girlfriend attacking the boyfriend saying \"you do this and you do this and you're a selfish so-and-so\". Anyway, it doesn't matter because as the author put it, \"this book does not attempt to provide the solution to racism\" (pg. 5)... I mean, it took her 27 pages (including her author's note, but not including the foreword in which Michael Eric Dyson refers to Beyonce as an authority because, um, not sure-she's a person of color (POC ;) )? maybe, she sent money to bail out protestors?, maybe, she's a beautiful celebrity and he wants to ingratiate himself to her? hmmm, I really don't know, he doesn't tell us, and googling didn't come up with anything) to define the definition of racism she's using in her book, because the definition of racism we whites have is too simplistic and not what she means (shh-yes it is ;) ). So, for 27 pages us white people are like... what's up? Meanwhile, she sets the framework for her argument in such a way that white people can't say anything against what she's laying down (actually we can't even NOT say anything, because that's somehow also racist?...), really it's a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" kind of scenario, along with many of the scenarios exemplified in this book in which white people try to help make society better but we're just... no. It's childish really, framing her argument in a way in which she sets the rules where she always wins (kinda like institutional racism! Ha-look ma, no hands!). EXCEPT, it is obvious. And sad--for POC, for people really looking for insight because it's assigned reading for a college course, for our society, etc.: In my opinion, she is one of the \"white progressives\" she talks about that \"cause the most daily damage to people of color\" (pg.5), and this entire book, (at least up until pg. 47--sorry, I couldn't wait to write the review because my head was spinning, I may update if it changes with the next 2/3s of the book, but I don't see that happening) is an example of \"aversion racism\" (pg. 43) because, as I said above, she is absolutely racist against people of color (see especially pgs. 44-45), and while I suppose she never claims otherwise, I guess she thinks that every white person is like her? Maybe too much \"white guilt\"? Maybe she doesn't realize that the evidence she uses for her argument is from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s and is not as relevant as it may have been, say in the 90s? Not to say that racism isn't alive today, but it is truly unfortunate that she chose to simply be nasty \"for effect?\" (my emphasis, not a quote) and lump every single person who exhibits \"whiteness\" (regardless of actual skin color and ethnicity) into a group which is, according to her, acceptable because, as a group, those whose exhibit \"whiteness\" are the ones who gain advantage in our society and keep the status quo. I'm still waiting to see what her definition of \"whiteness\" is, if she ever does define it. The author contradicts herself numerous times and exhibits bigotry as if it was going out of style--really doing nothing for what she is trying to accomplish in her book. Wait, maybe it does because she isn't actually trying to solve anything, but illuminate how white people can do things to avoid meaningful conversation... Trying to contextualize this book, I find her timing to be very revealing about her intentions. As I said, if she had published this 3 decades ago, perhaps it would have a different effect besides spreading hate reminiscent of the time when she grew up. Because let's face it, that is her framework--growing up in the 60s when the SHTF with civil rights and change was really happening in a traumatic way. She talks about the \"new racism\", but she's referring to stuff from 1981. She talks about the power of socialization, but her mindset is stuck back then. There has been tremendous effort to reform how our society is \"socialized\" when it comes to treating everyone equitably. Our country has been going through change where, maybe not everybody, but many \"white\" people are are genuinely (if not appropriately or sufficiently or good enough in others' opinions) trying to make our world reflect the belief that humans are humans and should be treated as such. No, I'm not trying to invalidate anyone's experience. What happened in our history was awful, evil, and shouldn't have ever happened--but it did. And there's still work to be done. And we--the collective we, not just whites, not just POC--all of us who claim to care, need to be the change that makes our world the one we want to live in--and not simply write about it in an inflammatory way to secure sales of books. This is also where the author is wrong in her argument: us whites aren't denying that despicable wrongs have been done, that white people have tipped the scales so that POC have been adversely affected, and that POC are still fighting to overcome those barriers. Additionally, she disregards all of the efforts of the \"white allies\" who have fought racism from the beginning, and those of us in this day and age, who are more than happy to shrug off the illusions of \"superiority\" to do the right thing because we know us whites dealt them a crappy deal. But I guess she got what she wanted.",

        "review_text": "I find it amusing that at no point does the author consider the following possibility- that 'white people' do not react negatively to conversations about race per se, but that it is simply the way SHE has such conversations that upsets people. Since almost all the 'evidence' base for this book is entirely from the authors own experience.....the clear conclusion is that she just pisses people off when she gives her seminars. Should she be surprised that when you tell people that somehow they are not individuals and are a monolith driven by forces that they do not understand....but magically she DOES understand....that they will be pissed off? Does she make any attempt to actually understand what people who have objected to 'conversations about race' are actually thinking and feeling....of course not because they are white so must all be thinking and feeling the same thing. After all, 'socialisation' is everything. Obviously everyone grows up and watches exactly the same films, listens to exactly the same music, has exactly the same interactions with teachers, different ethnic groups- and reacts in exactly the same way to all of these things- and its all because they are white that this happens. Jesus. I would want to give the author the following advice: stop addressing people by their group identification, stop making assumptions about people that are unfounded and take responsibility to provide proper evidence for your assertions that consider critically different possible interpretations. If you do that, PEOPLE WILL STOP BEING ANGRY AT YOUR SEMINARS AND PRESENTATIONS. And they will actually listen. People get angry when you demean them, try to mislead them, make unfounded assumptions about them and do not listen to their perspective or give them the respect of feeling the need to justify properly your objections to their viewpoint. The vast majority of people, regardless of race, are happy to have conversations about it- if it is respectful and evidence based. Period.",

When it is pointed out that they may be practising racism or, at least passively benefiting from it, some may respond with anger or hurt. This book explains and gives examples of all the above. It then suggests that rather than being \"fragile\" white people should pause, reflect and examine the life led and its nuances and how they can work towards challenging discrimination and help work towards a fair and just world in which rewards are given for merit and effort not skin colour.

I listened to this on audiobook (which I would recommend) and found it a powerful and painful argument. I have heard a lot of self justification and self reassurance but I’ve never heard this perspective. We whites owe it to our fellow humans to listen and consider these points of view which focus on the wider insidious nature of the racial divide. I do wonder why the criticism is so angry and vociferous when we have clearly not solved this massive problem.

    "full_description": "“Propulsive” — Time. * “Reads like a tense thriller.” — The Washington Post * “The most exciting book I’ve read all year.” —Admiral William H. McRaven From Chris Wallace, the veteran journalist and anchor of Fox News Sunday , comes an electrifying behind-the-scenes account of the 116 days leading up to the American attack on Hiroshima. April 12, 1945: After years of bloody conflict in Europe and the Pacific, America is stunned by news of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death. In an instant, Vice President Harry Truman, who has been kept out of war planning and knows nothing of the top-secret Manhattan Project to develop the world’s first atomic bomb, must assume command of a nation at war on multiple continents—and confront one of the most consequential decisions in history. Countdown 1945 tells the gripping true story of the turbulent days, weeks, and months to follow, leading up to August 6, 1945, when Truman gives the order to drop the bomb on Hiroshima. In Countdown 1945 , Chris Wallace, the veteran journalist and anchor of Fox News Sunday , takes readers inside the minds of the iconic and elusive figures who join the quest for the bomb, each for different reasons: the legendary Albert Einstein, who eventually calls his vocal support for the atomic bomb “the one great mistake in my life”; lead researcher J. Robert “Oppie” Oppenheimer and the Soviet spies who secretly infiltrate his team; the fiercely competitive pilots of the plane selected to drop the bomb; and many more. Perhaps most of all, Countdown 1945 is the story of an untested new president confronting a decision that he knows will change the world forever. Truman’s journey during these 116 days is a story of high drama: from the shock of learning of the bomb’s existence, to the conflicting advice he receives from generals like Dwight D. Eisenhower and George Marshall, to wrestling with the devastating carnage that will result if he gives the order to use America’s first weapon of mass destruction. But Countdown 1945 is more than a book about the atomic bomb. It’s also an unforgettable account of the lives of ordinary American and Japanese civilians in wartime—from “Calutron Girls” like Ruth Sisson in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to ten-year-old Hiroshima resident Hideko Tamura, who survives the blast at ground zero but loses her mother and later immigrates to the United States, where she lives to this day—as well as American soldiers fighting in the Pacific, waiting in fear for the order to launch a possible invasion of Japan. Told with vigor, intelligence, and humanity, Countdown 1945 is the definitive account of one of the most significant moments in history.",

        "review_text": "interesting reading experience. Chris Wallace is much more enjoyable in writing than on T. V. - or maybe it’s the subject matter? Whatever the reason, “Countdown 1945” had my attention from 3:30 am until I finished it 4.5 hours later. Wallace wrote with Mitch Weiss, (an investigative reporter for the A. P.), as his co-author and it is a brilliant pairing. The editing and publishing is also top notch. The book is written from a 3rd person POV and begins by introducing the key players involved in the 116 days that lead up to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: President Truman, key members of the Manhattan Project, a 10 year old survivor from Hiroshima and a woman who worked at a plant that supported the effort. These civilians are real and some are still living today. Their stories are authentic and compelling and bring the history to life, giving it a rare and unusual richness. Those 116 days are used as an organizational component for the book; the countdown, if you will. It adds an element of tension and expectation to the reading experience and made me feel like I HAD TO keep turning pages. To start with, those individual days were multiple pages long. Then, the closer we got to day 1, fewer pages were allocated between days and ultimately, the countdown was in hours and minutes and the breakouts were in paragraphs and then sentences; VERY effective. I had seen the movies about The Manhattan Project but it wasn’t until reading this book that much of the interplay between government, industry and civilian life became clear. There’s a spirit of cooperation, patriotism and willingness to sacrifice that is quietly inherent in the people this story is told thru. It’s an inspiring read, which is a strange thing to say when the story is about unleashing the only nuclear bomb ever deployed in warfare, but it’s how I felt about the PEOPLE, not the event. “Countdown 1945” is well written, it’s history, it’s biographical and it’s often like reading a good thriller only this time you will know the outcome when you get started; a worthy read📚",

        "review_text": "On April 12, 1945… Franklin D. Roosevelt early in his FOURTH TERM AS UNITED STATES PRESIDENT… dies… and “Give ’em Hell” Harry Truman takes over as President. A top-top-top secret project code-named the Manhattan Project… had been underway and spearheaded by FDR for years. How top secret was it? Well… even the Vice-President of the United States knew nothing about it! The Manhattan Project’s goal was to create the world’s first atomic bomb… and if so created… could not only shorten World War II… but end it… and also… despite how deadly it could be… it would also save hundreds of thousands of lives. The first order of business… upon FDR’s passing was to bring new President Harry Truman up to date on the world-changing secret project. The author’s do a wonderful job in laying out all the different cast of characters… many with differing beliefs as to whether humanity and the world should face the earth and world changing powers of a successful atomic bomb invention and detonation Along with wonderful fingernail sketches of the backgrounds of the elaborate individuals involved in the creation… training… and advisory.. decision making.. and actual carrying out of the plan… it is simply amazing… that with “more than 125,000 men and women working on the project at installations all over the United States”… other than a handful of top level people… no one else had any idea what they were working on. As the author’s deftly take you through the scientists, the pilots… the politicians… the civilians… the educators… and more… you’re constantly reminded that other than a select few… over 100,000 people went to work every day without even knowing what the knobs on machines they twisted and adjusted all day every day were even doing. A select few pilots and bombardiers practiced continuously to be ready for a mission they knew nothing about. From the greatest scientists… professors… researchers… and nuclear engineers (many were European Jews… who were available in the United States… because they fled once Hitler took over power) along with the everyday men and women who did jobs with no idea that they were a piece of a world changing… and possibly world ending project. The way the author weaves all these disparate minute pieces together… to lead to the stories finished atomic product is simply… masterly done. Even one single reporter was chosen to be brought in to the inner circle of the project… not only without full knowledge of the end result… but being told he couldn’t tell anyone where he was going. He was literally told “YOU WILL FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, DISAPPEAR OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.” Not one word would go out until Major General Groves gave the word. As a longtime admirer of Harry Truman… who I feel has not been celebrated by history in an appropriate manner… this book does a fine job emphasizing his no-nonsense decision making skills… his ability to admit what he knows and doesn’t know… his classic comments… his street level language… and his never backing down from a situation. Actual quotes from Truman’s personal diary interspersed with the countdown to the atomic-nuclear age… gives the reader an almost “real-time” feeling as you read. His thoughts upon his first face to face meeting with Russian dictator Joseph Stalin in Potsdam, Germany on July 17, 1945 is a wonderful example… “Now just before noon on the seventeenth, Truman looked up from his desk. And there he was: Joseph Stalin, “the Man of Steel”, dictator of the Soviet Union, the man Truman knew from newsreels towering over his generals, Communist Party leaders, and peasants. But here in person… all five feet five inches of him… Stalin looked to Truman like “a little bit of a squirt.”” If you haven’t watched the one- hour Fox News special with Chris Wallace recently broadcast about this book… I would recommend NOT watching it until after you read this. I watched it before my copy of the book arrived… and I found that a good deal of the accounts… especially from the Japanese side… were weakened… some of the intrigue in the flow of the book was tamped down as a result.",

    "full_description": "The National Book Award winning history of how racist ideas were created, spread, and deeply rooted in American society. Some Americans insist that we're living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America--it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis. As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial inequities. In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope. Praise for Stamped from the Beginning: \"We often describe a wonderful book as 'mind-blowing' or 'life-changing' but I've found this rarely to actually be the case. I found both descriptions accurate for Ibram X. Kendi's Stamped from the Beginning... I will never look at racial discrimination again after reading this marvellous, ambitious, and clear-sighted book.\" - George Saunders, Financial Times, Best Books of 2017 \"Ambitious, well-researched and worth the time of anyone who wants to understand racism.\" - Seattle Times \"A deep (and often disturbing) chronicling of how anti-black thinking has entrenched itself in the fabric of American society.\" - The Atlantic - Winner of the 2016 National Book Award for Nonfiction - A New York Times Bestseller - A Washington Post Bestseller - Finalist for the 2016 National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction - Named one of the Best Books of the Year by the Boston Globe, - Washington Post, Chicago Review of Books, The Root, Buzzfeed, Bustle, and Entropy",

I just completed part one, and while reading it I had to put this book down and weep multiple times. They say we don't see the world as it is… we see it as we are. We wake up every morning and open our eyes to a world that has been created for us. We breathe in ideas, thoughts, philosophies, opinions that created the world we live in. We believe what we have been told to believe. We think what we've been told to think. And until we trace the roots of our human history and the ideas they created it, we will never understand the world we live in or the world inside our own minds. Thank you, Ibram X. Kendi, for helping me to begin to trace some of the roots of the philosophies that rule our lives today. It is only in knowledge and understanding that we can undo the damage that's been done. I am undone… This book is incredible, brutal, devastating, truthful… necessary. Read it… weep . . . and then change yourself and your world.",

        "review_text": "About halfway through reading this book, I realized I was highlighting almost every single page and had to start color-coding my highlights so as to make a little more sense of why certain passages struck me—a visual testimony of how illuminating Stamped from the Beginning is. With a primary focus on racism toward African-Americans and people identified as Black, this book is a thoroughly researched, sweepingly comprehensive survey of racism from its first traceable roots in ancient Greece when Aristotle said Africans had “burnt faces” to the start of the African slave trade in 15th century Europe, to the first recorded slave ship arriving in colonial America in 1619, all the way through the Civil War, the Jim Crow laws, the 1960s Civil Rights movement, and up to the present day. In order to help readers navigate this extensive timeline, author Ibram X. Kendi divides the book into five parts, featuring one historical figure as a sort of tour guide or anchor for each part. Very few individuals or institutions mentioned in this book come off as completely free of racist thinking; even many abolitionists and civil rights activists are revealed to have held racist ideas that contradicted their cause. This made me realize the extent to which racism has ensnared the United States in its pernicious roots. In Stamped from the Beginning, Kendi presents two main ideas about racism that helped me understand its influence and progress over the centuries. First, he explains that “Hate and ignorance have not driven the history of racist ideas in America. Racist policies have driven the history of racist ideas in America.” The author admits, “I was taught the popular folktale of racism: that ignorant and hateful people had produced racist ideas, and that these racist people had instituted racist policies. But when I learned the motives behind the production of many of America’s most influentially racist ideas, it became quite obvious that this folktale, though sensible, was not based on a firm footing of historical evidence.” As Kendi explains further, “Racially discriminatory policies have usually sprung from economic, political, and cultural self-interests, self-interests that are constantly changing.” Now that I understand self-interest—not hate or ignorance—has been the driving factor behind racist policies, I can better understand why racism hasn’t died out with the Emancipation Proclamation or desegregation or any of the Civil Rights Acts passed in this country. Tragically, racism persists and continues to evolve according to the current self-interests of people and institutions in power. It’s why, after slavery was abolished, segregation and the Jim Crow laws rushed in to replace it, and long after segregation has been outlawed, African-Americans continue to be oppressed by disproportionate mass incarceration as well as disadvantaged by fewer, inferior housing and employment opportunities. Second, Kendi points out that racism is not simply a debate between those who support racist ideas and those who oppose racist ideas. Throughout history, three–not two–viewpoints on racism have persisted: “A group we can call segregationists has blamed Black people themselves for the racial disparities. A group we can call antiracists has pointed to racial discrimination. A group we can call assimilationists has tried to argue for both, saying that Black people and racial discrimination were to blame for racial disparities.” As much as I would like to believe I am firmly in the antiracist camp, reading this book made me realize I have held a lot of racist ideas from an assimilationist viewpoint that I need to correct. Kendi gives many examples of well-meaning civil rights activists, including some African-Americans, who upheld assimilationist ideas. Some persisted with these ideas their entire lives, others realized their error and later self-corrected to an antiracist viewpoint, and still others upheld both antiracist and assimilationist ideas, often not realizing the contradiction. Thus, a tragic pattern that has repeated itself throughout American history is the persistence of many assimilationists in seeking to abolish racist policies and ideas with the same flawed strategies that never work. Indeed, the African-American author admits, “Even though I am an African studies historian and have been tutored all my life in egalitarian spaces, I held racist notions of Black inferiority before researching and writing this book.” I think it’s crucially important that Kendi tells readers about his mistaken notions of race—not to make readers feel better about their own ignorance, but to demonstrate how deeply racist ideas have taken root in American culture. Hopefully this admission on the author’s part will ease readers out of their defensive mode and open their minds to the disturbing truth that racism is a lot more pervasive among us Americans than we would like to believe. If you want to understand exactly how racism took root in the United States and why it has persisted through the present day, if you are prepared for a very sobering, very painful, and often highly disturbing look at the many flaws, hypocrisies, and atrocities in the American notions of democracy, exceptionalism, and “liberty and justice for all,” then Stamped from the Beginning is a must-read. Ultimately, what the author conveys with copious examples is that “Black Americans’ history of oppression has made Black opportunities—not Black people—inferior.” An absolutely necessary emendation to the traditionally accepted canon of American history.",

        "review_text": "Kendi pathologically cherry-picks his data. When discussing race and health, he laments that blacks are more likely than whites to HAVE Alzheimer’s disease, openly implying that this demonstrates clear anti- Black racism in the medical field. Of course, he neglects to mention that Whites are more likely to DIE from Alzheimer, according to the Center for Disease Control. In the same vein, Kendi notes that blacks are more likely than whites to die of prostate cancer and breast cancer, but he does not include the fact that blacks are less likely than whites to die of esophageal cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and leukemia. By selectively citing data that show blacks suffering more than whites, Kendi turns what should be a unifying, race-neutral battle ground––namely, humanity’s fight against deadly diseases––into another proxy battle in the War on Racism. The entire book is filled with this kind of imaginary stuff. Unfortunately, It would require 5 whole books to debunk all the errors in this publication. - This book was nothing but a rushed political propaganda published in an election year (2016). Unfortunately it did not work and it will work even less in 2020 as Trump has unprecedented black support for a republican candidate.",

Still, it is a difficult subject to talk about. How do you tell your roommate her jokes are racist? Why did your sister-in-law take umbrage when you asked to touch her hair--and how do you make it right? How do you explain white privilege to your white, privileged friend? In So You Want to Talk About Race , Ijeoma Oluo guides readers of all races through subjects ranging from intersectionality and affirmative action to \"model minorities\" in an attempt to make the seemingly impossible possible: honest conversations about race and racism, and how they infect almost every aspect of American life. \"Oluo gives us--both white people and people of color--that language to engage in clear, constructive, and confident dialogue with each other about how to deal with racial prejudices and biases.\" --National Book Review \"Generous and empathetic, yet usefully blunt . . . it's for anyone who wants to be smarter and more empathetic about matters of race and engage in more productive anti-racist action.\" -- Salon (Required Reading)",

        "review_text": "What author would write a book with a target audience that is likely to consider reading it, much less paying for it, akin to wishing for a root canal? Apparently, Ijeoma Oluo. I am a white, sexagenarian, male, and former CEO. I am, therefore, a r#cist. (And yes, I am being sensitive to the censors who will look at this before posting it.) And I accept that because this isn’t about me. My personal tolerance is irrelevant. If a picture says a thousand words, an action is worth ten thousand pictures. That is how we should judge each other. From my very privileged position in America, I have had a bird’s eye view of the systemic, institutional privilege (which in the negative is discrimination) that currently defines virtually all Western institutions today, including virtually all corporations. Women have not shattered the corporate glass ceiling because the corporate institution was designed and built by men. Blacks have not achieved equity in the economic arena because it was designed by white men. Which is why, as Ijeoma points out, it really doesn’t matter if the man in charge is a racist or a misogynist or not. The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements are all about gender and racial discrimination. What has enabled misogyny and racism, however, is the definition and allocation of power in our institutions and our society. Tolerance is great, but it’s nowhere near enough. Until we challenge the structure of power, we will not address the underlying cause of social and economic injustice. Here are the main takeaways I got from this book: - It’s not about me or Ijeoma. This is about structural injustice. - It’s not about the tone of the discussion. This is about structural injustice. - It’s not about intent. This is about structural injustice. - It’s not about who is right and who is wrong. This is about structural injustice. - It’s not about who can use what words. This is about structural injustice. In the end, the great strength and the great weakness of our political economy is our over-riding emphasis on the individual and his or her opportunities and rights. There’s nothing wrong with that per se. But in this crowded, technologically enabled world we live in, it’s not enough. We can live individually but we can only be judged collectively. Our insistence that every conversation be about me, or you, or Ijeoma, or that person over there, is blinding us to the degree that we really are all in this together. Scientists used to view the environment as a collection of independent and discrete parts. There was a prairie here, an Arctic ice field there, and a rain forest someplace a long way away. They now realize, however, that there is only one ecosystem and what happens in the rain forest is just as important as what happens in the Iowa corn field. Other scientists have discovered the same thing about the other hard and soft sciences. Biology and economics don’t cut it any more. We have to think in terms of evolutionary biology and behavioral economy. Real understanding lies not just within a functional discipline, but also in the spaces that separates them and the overlaps that interconnect them. So, I go back to my original question. Why did Ijeoma write this book? I won’t pretend to know the answer but it is clear that she has a genuine desire to see us face the issue. And after reading this book it is clear that the desire is genuine. And while it is theoretically true that if she is successful she will have to find something new to write about, so what? That is exactly the kind of binary, digital thinking that is at the heart of the problem. Life is not either/or. It is, with tolerance, and/but. Ijeoma has a perspective. And the tone is sometimes a bit harsh. But how could it not be? In the end I think the most amazing and laudable thing about her language is that she obviously worked so hard to keep a lid on her passion. If she were white, we would elect her to high office. Am I appropriating Ijeoma’s book by writing this review? Yes. But that’s irrelevant. I am not her. And my appropriation is going to paint racism with a white brush and, potentially, demean that pain. But that is the thinking of a binary thinker—either/or. And that, in the end, is what we have to overcome. Tolerant people are not binary thinkers. Tolerance is not a function of embracing the other side of the binary issue. It is about eliminating the binary divide. Ultimately, the racism talked about here is about institutional models of power that disadvantage one group over another. (And, as Ijeoma points out, there are many.) In the end, I won’t say this was the most pleasant read. It was, however, a good read. It made me think. And for that I am grateful to the author. I won’t say, “well done,” because that would be an appropriation, as if I could evaluate how well she had represented her pain. I can’t. It’s hers, not mine. I will say, however, that “I listened.” And I listened because you were clear and authentic. And I do thank you for that. A must read. Period.",

        "review_text": "I attended a book club the other morning, “So You Want to Talk About Race” by a young social-justice warrior, Ijeoma Oluo. I went to help me understand why people believe what they believe, listen and learn. It quickly became about identity. Before each person spoke, they announced their identity before making their comments- black/Chinese, legal immigrant, white with a hired black in my household, etc., which confirms a racist point that you can’t talk or be heard about race unless you are not white. White people often get attacked for having opinions about race and are called white supremacist or white privileged because for some reason, we have white guilt on our hands. I hated this book. It made me cringe on every page. We need to have a conversation, or so this book leads you to believe. This book is more of a lecture about her opinions of her experience with racism than a conversation using facts. She uses emotions to help lure you into her “disadvantages” of growing up Mulatto in Seattle with a white mom in a white city (I can think of worse places to live and more hostile environments). For young Ijeoma, every injustice was related to her skin color. Every job that passed her by was because she was black. Cringe. Her definition of racism is absurd. I recommend everyone re-read her definition but reverse the words black for white. Or for that matter Hispanic for white. I bet that gives you a little bit of the cringe I felt when I read it. Her rules of engagement to conversations were one-sided and left many white folk handicapped since we are not permitted to “force” blacks into conversations because it’s “too painful and exhausting” on “them” to defend themselves. Not to pivot to another problem with our education system, the rewriting of history to suit their agenda, but this idea that “we” whites owe reparations to blacks including giving up our “advantages” that we earned to support their perceived “disadvantages”, can lead to a zero sum game. For every winner, someone must be a loser until we reach “equality” which she never defines where the end game is. This idea of oppressing one race for another will only widen the gap between races and weaken the chance of any real healing. She could have used some facts. They are out there but she chose to ignore them so she could simplify her arguments and correlate anything negative that happens to a black person is due to racism. Yes, racial bias exists. Prejudice exists. It exists between races and within races. But it is insulting to Americans of any race to be blamed for bad outcomes of blacks. Statistically speaking, problems with black kids in school, crime, prison and police activity all point to the fact that 69% of black households are single parent. They systemically lose the benefit of economics, education, and health and allows easy access for criminal behavior. She says Travon “stand up don’t shoot” Martin was her motivator in becoming an activist. She must be disremembering the fact that George Zimmerman acted in self defense and was acquitted of any crime. I’m sure she still believes Jusse Smollett had an attempted hanging one cold winter morning in Chicago by a Trump supporter. Black activist are very quick to activate for any white on black or cop on black crime without all the facts and never back down when their story doesn’t play out to meet their agenda. They are okay with Black Lives Matter destroying public property in cities all over the country, tearing down statues of historic US leaders, changing school names, town names, and lake names because they were once slave owners. White guilt must exist. There is no end to their social justice agenda. Many white elitist are sympathetic to the racial justice movement. This book is specifically taking aim at them. Ijeoma would want nothing more than to use them to push Institutional policy changes for schools, businesses, governments, and all private institutions of all kinds. She wants whites to surrender their power and accept that it’s necessary to chose a black candidate over a white candidate on the basis of race. Maybe we should ask them, are you willing to forfeit your child’s spot at this school and give it to a “disadvantaged” child? Actions speak louder than words. Ijeoma is part of a revolution. She is part of socialism. She is part of identity politics. And for me, she is part of the problem.",

Oluo addresses topics that you may hesitate to raise with black friends, encourages you to revisit your understanding of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X and explains concepts including emotional labor and white privilege. Consider this anti-racism 101. For white folks ready for the 200-level anti-racism course -- people who are ready to accept that White Supremacy is real and that they've benefited from it -- Oluo offers additional challenges. I especially appreciated her call toward the end of the book to move beyond talk and into action. Find a place, whether it's your kids' school or the local political scene, and use your privilege to help dismantle systems that have done so much damage to people of color. If you're not ready for this book or don't view discussions of race as a necessary part of your life as a white person, I'd encourage you to read \"Between the World and Me\" by Ta-Nehisi Coates and \"Just Mercy\" by Bryan Stevenson, both of which led me to empathy and anger and prompted me to speak out in ways I hadn't previously.",

Many of the chapters addressed issues I had no idea existed, and I especially loved the chapters on microaggressions and the model minority myth. I know that I will still make mistakes, but this book has given me the confidence to take action when I see racism in action. Thank you, Ijeoma.

She writes with such precision and fierceness about topics that many writers shy away from. Her personal stories are easy to relate to, even if I do not share the same experiences of racism, and her writing style is so accessible (point form lists of what actions to take when talking to a white person about race). If you are black, indigenous, or a person of colour, I guarantee that there is at least one question in the book that will still be new to you and you will be humbled and learn a lot. If you are a white person, be prepared to be uncomfortable because you will learn more than most, so make sure you have a highlighter/pen on hand to take notes.

Ijeoma's prose is empathetic, engaging, easy to follow, laden with historical examples and contexts, and backed by credible data and sources. She wants to get you talking about it. She also does not sugarcoat a thing. For marginalised people, but ESPECIALLY black people, this may be a bit of a draining read in places. I highly recommend it, but Ijeoma lays extremely bare her own personal experiences, ones that resonated with me and might do the same for you in a way that may leave you raw, bitter, cynical, hurting, scared, frustrated, uncertain, livid, and a host of other things, not the least of which is Tired. She makes you feel. That might be more than you want to deal with at times, but, if nothing else, it reinforces that you are not alone. There is also plenty of levity and working optimism, so it is not all bad. Many sections are addressed to white people, but, like she, I recommend it to everyone, especially if you're part of a marginalised group and know something doesn't sit well with you or if you come across something racially charged, but have no idea how to approach or articulate it or if you even should. It's a great help in that regard. The title also does the book a bit of a disservice, because it discusses INTERSECTIONALITY, which is of paramount importance. Race intersecting with things like gender and sexual identity, mental health, ability, others, and their impacts. It's something of all-around guide to people of today, incredibly relevant and handy to have and handles the topic thoughtfully. Not only does she challenge white people, but black people, others, the system, and, actually, herself. She challenges us all to be better, more mindful, considerate and inclusive. The tragedy of this book is that it needed to be written at all, but it's absolutely wonderful, worth your time, your money, and your consideration.",

Utilissimo, una lettura essenziale per capire quanta strada c’è da fare per una vera uguaglianza,",

I didn't want this story to end!\"--Reese Witherspoon \"Painfully beautiful.\"-- The New York Times Book Review For years, rumors of the \"Marsh Girl\" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable happens. Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.",

While the reading is good, the story is so nonsensical- a 6 year old left alone in a shack raises herself, living in the same shack, using the same boat, and no one lifts a hand to help her? In more than 20 years, the boat never breaks down, the house doesn't need repairs and she's able to wear the same clothes for many years....she's got long hair that she says is ratty and tangled but description s of it has it down her back, luxurious...she's gorgeous but bathing is optional until in her 20s...she has sex with a philanderer but never gets a vd and not once apparently does she get sick. No flu, cold, nothing....she never got shots and apparently has the immune system of a super hero because she stepped on a nail and never got tetanus....I kept reading so I'd finish and the ending is unexpected but it's generally a boring book where day after day, she's alone in the marsh....",

I grew up in coastal North Carolina and was born in the 40s, so would be the same age as the main characters. It was clear that the author did not do her research about the area and about what would be plausible at the time of the story. When she mentioned real towns, she should have known Asheville would not be the destination city from the coast, especially in the 60s. Ma's old cardboard suitcase that had been in the closet in the marsh for 19 years would be covered in mildew, Fireflies would have been called lightening bugs. No boy in a small town in NC would have been named either Tate or Chase in 40s, more recent popular names. I could go on and on. The inconsistencies in the dialect was grating, and many parts of the story were just not believable to me. I am amazed that so many people loved the book and the poetry.",

I'm from NC and have never heard anyone talk with the type of accents Ms. Owens chose for her characters.

It made me wonder if the author has ever been to our fair state. The story was good enough, albeit predictable, and it's obvious the author did her research on marsh life. I learned quite a few wildlife facts that were interesting. The conversations just kept me wrinkling up my nose with distaste and I ended the book on a sour note.",

Jumpin' became a trusted friend and so many moments touched my very soul. I should not have been surprised as Delia has a great style in her wildlife books that I love to read. But a novel like this is not my normal read. Maybe I need to now reconsider what I choose as this book stopped me cold and made me rethink a lot that happened in my life. Delia touched the human soul with her behavioral descriptions. She is not only a respected wildlife scientist, she is a human behaviorist and understands more about the human condition that just about anyone else I know.

I have to confess that I have also had magical moments with marsh creatures such as herons, eagles, and mud turtles. Like the main character, Kya, I am a compulsive collector of treasures from those Great Rock Tumblers: the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean which makes this book so attractive to me.

        "review_text": "This story of a six-year-old child left to fend for herself in a Carolina swamp when her stereotype swamp-trash likker-sluggin' pa finally doesn't come home again (we're not told why - hopefully an alligator ate him), is an exercise in cliches. We are asked to believe that this beautiful (natch), sensitive, artistic blah blah little girl raises herself from barefoot illiteracy to womanhood and published fame as a naturalist, with three self-illustrated books on marshland flora and fauna. She is taught to read and overnight to abandon her swamp patois for highbrow English by, gosh, a boy who falls in love with her, and manages to educate her to university level with some textbooks. Said boy, having achieved this Pygmalion-like transformation, then departs to do his own high-class degree, promising to return to his true love, who hangs around the swamp waiting. But he doesn't return because alas! he realises she is a wild creature, a child of nature who would never fit into civilisation, and so on. So he passes on coming back to claim her and Swamp Girl's heart broken. She has a fling with the baddie of the piece, another walking cliche - handsome, privileged, all the girls want to go to the prom with him - and predictably he breaks her heart by marrying an appropriate girl who wears shoes and pearls. Really at this point I was ready to give up on the novel, but there is a murder involved and I wanted to find out whodunnit. The murder itself is just a device and fails hopelessly. The trial is ludicrous, the murder allegations are based on evidence that no prosecuting counsel, fictional or otherwise, would have even remotely considered sound, and the attempts to build suspense during the jury's deliberations are just plain silly. If this flimsy and wholly ridiculous plot line were in any way to be redeemed, it might have been through quality of writing because of the interesting environment of the swamp and its wildlife, but even in this the novel fails. The only passable passages are indeed the ones in which Ms Owens describes the swamp life. The dialogue is ridiculous, the love scenes are stitched together out of worn-out cliches, and the suspension of disbelief required of the reader is just asking way too much. I have no doubt that Delia Owens is an excellent naturalist and ecologist and an asset to her field. But as a novelist, she doesn't cut it. Don't waste your money on this book.",

        "review_text": "“There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot” For months now – since it was the September 2018 Reece Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club choice – I have seen nothing but glowing reviews of this seminal novel. It will, I am sure become a classic in its own right (there, I have already given away how I feel about the book!). The actress has also optioned the film rights for it. This is the story of Kya, shortened from Catherine Danielle, who lives in the swampy marshes of North Caroline, not far from Asheville. Her mother walked out on her when she was young and she still has visions of her departure, suitcase in hand, faux snakeskin shoes, tripping her way down the track and out of sight. Her older siblings have also abandoned life in the little homestead, leaving her with her oftentimes drunk and violent father; he is around less and less as he fritters away any income, there is money neither for food nor clothes. To all intents and purposes she is abandoned by those who are important in her life and she is tasked with raising herself, this little “marsh girl” who has nothing in her life but the nature surrounding their hovel. The birds and wildlife are her companions. Oh, and she has access to her father’s small boat which gives her some mobility. She is adept at cruising the waterways. Years pass and her loneliness becomes entrenched. Tate is drawn to this skinny young girl but ultimately he forsakes her for his studies, leaving her abandoned once again. Soon she is befriended by Chase, a dapper young man about town, a womaniser and who, we know, is found dead at the outset of the novel lying at the bottom of the Fire Tower. Natural suspicion amongst the nearby townsfolk falls on Kya because she is an oddball, she lives in poverty, she is different…. and she is female. Remember this is a time in American history when there was discrimination against anyone who was different to the overwhelmingly white populace. The author has an acute eye for capturing people, prejudices and small town life. Kya, surrounded by the natural world starts to record what she sees and experiences. This holds her in good stead as her life develops. Yet she is no match as a single, lonely girl for the bigoted views held by those around her. A storm of prejudice and a need to see justice done, at any cost, whips through the community, targeting her as the only viable suspect in the murder case. Loneliness is a theme throughout the novel that makes this a particularly heartfelt and poignant story. What makes this a fabulous read are the rich descriptions, the language and the languorous pace that, just like the waterways, move the story along at just the right tempo. The setting comes to life beautifully. The writing and storytelling has been compared to the work of Barbara Kingsolver and I can really see why! The title comes from common parlance in the area and means …far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters… I was sad when this book came to an end and it is still vibrantly with me, a couple of weeks down the line. It indeed has all the hallmarks of a future classic! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

The author’s unsurpassed knowledge and understanding of ‘nature’ and the natural world is more than matched by her beautiful descriptive poetic prose. Her keen and insightful observations on our society, on relationships,love, prejudice, racism and sexism are intermingled with a fast paced and gripping story which takes us on an emotional journey that, although set in the 30’s through to the 70’s, is even more relevant today than it was then. In the era of ‘me too’ - we should take heed and learn from this incredible, vivid and at times disturbing reflection on humanity (or inhumanity) as seen through the eyes of nature itself. We have a lot to learn from this book about our natural world and our relationship with it. I place this novel amongst the classics of all time - an easy match for any of the greats - Thomas Hardy, DH Lawrence JD Salinger. Delia Owens is up there with the very best. This book brought me to tears many times and pulled at every emotion you can possible think of. Congratulations on an epic first novel.

She lived in a swamp and learned about the ecology of that swamp and became not only an expert on the area but an artist who recorded the whole area. A murder occurs and she was accused of it. She was taken into custody and was away from her swamp for as she was put on trial. The whole book is wonderful ..a story of survival in the face of prejudice, of poverty and loneliness. A definite must read.",

Absurd plot, dreadful dialogue, terrible sex scenes - absolutely nothing to recommend this over-acclaimed novel. The notion of an illiterate marsh girl self-educating to the level of an academic research scientist beggars belief. Then the appalling poetry! I wish I had given it up long before I struggled to finish it. I couldn’t be bothered in the end - and I hate to abandon a novel.",

Kya quickly becomes more at ease with nature than people and her relationships with the opposite sex are traumatic. Delia Owens' rich,descriptive prose gives us a valuable insight into the scenery and wildlife of the region but most importantly the intriguing character of Kya. I gave this four stars because the beginning was painfully slow,the poetry becomes annoying after a time and the timetable of events at the Fire Tower seemed implausible.",

I find there's so many of the same (now boring) books out there that once I found this I couldn't put it down!! It is so interesting reading from the perspective of Kya, starting from when she is very young and how she learns to survive on her own, her outlook on the world from living so isolated for so long. The beautiful descriptions of the land and the marsh, I have never been to the marshes but the way Cordelia describes it through Kya it is so easy to imagine!! Love love loved this!! A story about nature, growing up, coming of age and survival. 10/10.",

If you enjoy tales of people stricken by hard luck then pulling themselves up by the bootstrap, possible murder mystery, courtroom drama, wildlife and romance, and even more, you have described this book. And like the proverbial cherry on top, it is beautifully written in both prose and a smattering of poetry. What's not to love. This is a book every mother should give to her daughter about the age twelve or thirteen. But men will appreciate it too. And there should be a film. If I ever read a book which should be a movie, this is it. Imagine you are the youngest girl in a family of five other siblings and Ma and Pa. Pa is an alcoholic abuser of his wife and most unpleasant fellow. After enduring him for years, Ma walks out of the marsh one day and never returns. This is only the beginning of the abandonment of Kya, five years old. I hope that peaked your interest as I have no intention of ruining one of the best stories I've ever read by telling you more. Let's just say, that you will never forget Kya long after you've finished the book. Where the Crawdads Sing is an extraordinary tale, well told.",

The natural science - of which there is too much - may be accurate; I cannot tell. The rest of the book is bad beyond belief. The plot is rickety; the characters are barely one-dimensional; the prose is sugary and sickening. As for the dialogue...most “sound” like cartoon characters. The nadir, though, are the truly dire poems, dropped haphazardly into the text. How this waste of space came to be published escapes me totally. Perhaps one can fool most of the people all the time. This is said to be the author’s first novel. On the evidence of this trash, she would be well advised not to think about a second.",

She manages to survive through many strife's until, years later, there is a body found and villagers, not knowing what else to do, point the finger at the Marsh girl they have come to fear over the years ....

        "review_text": "I enjoyed most of this book, and it was nicely written so it was quite easy to ignore some of the more irritating things, like constant head-hopping, and the fact that the main character's situation was a bit far-fetched. Her sudden change from wild child to (quite prim) author of brilliantly-received books was a bit of a jump; I'd have preferred to have read a little more about how it happened, that might have made it more believable. I thought that was brushed aside too quickly, and meant I didn't really experience it the way a reader should. The murder storyline held me for a while, but ultimately it was no surprise when I found the 'twist.' It was kind of telegraphed. The characters, which should have been the driving force behind what seemed like a literary novel at first, were mostly flat and cliched; that was a disappointment; much more could have been made of them, which would have enriched the reading experience. The brother coming and going was a bit pointless and went nowhere, and the white-hat/black-hat aspect of the two young men in Kya's life was another cliche that brought the rating down. The writing was often startlingly good, there were many sentences which really sang, but overall it all felt a bit cobbled together, and the intrigue felt shoe-horned in. Also it did feel a bit like a nature lesson at times, with the descriptions nicely done but unnecessary, and delivered in a very lecture-like way. Not as they'd be viewed from the 'Swamp Girl's' perspective. Overall then, I liked the writing, and the premise was promising, but I don't think it quite delivered in the end.",

    "full_description": "Ambition will fuel him. Competition will drive him. But power has its price. It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the Capitol, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute. The odds are against him. He’s been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined — every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute . . . and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.",

        "review_text": "In the time of Katniss Everdeen, Coriolanus Snow is the tyrannical president of Panem, a cruel man who uses the Hunger Games as a weapon against any who would rebel. But once, long ago, he was just a aristocratic teenage boy in the Capitol, raised in the shadow of a terrifying rebellion that gave birth to the Hunger Games. \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" is a look back at the early days of Panem’s dystopian tyranny, and a glimpse of how Snow turned into the president he would later become. This tale is a very different one from Suzanne Collins’ other Hunger Games tales, whether it’s the third-person narrative, the cold and ambitious protagonist, or the general feeling of hopelessness and ruin that you know is not really going to get any better. Born to the purple but raised in poverty, Coriolanus Snow is the only hope his grandmother and cousin Tigris have for any kind of comfort and dignity. He has to acquire a university prize and brilliant career in the upper echelons of the Capitol’s society, without ever betraying that he and his family are surviving on boiled cabbage and old outgrown clothes. If not, the Snow family will descend into… well, being ordinary poor people in the Districts, and Snow can’t bear the thought. But then he’s dealt a blow. When various young mentors are assigned to the Hunger Games tributes, he’s given the girl tribute from District 12: Lucy Gray Baird, a strange girl with a luscious singing voice and plenty of stage presence. Though he thinks she’s crazy at first, Snow is determined to make the best of his assignment, and he even begins to believe that Lucy Gray’s charm and charisma can somehow help him. The days before the Tenth Hunger Games are cruel to both the mentors and the tributes – there are bombings, venomous snakes, torture, and the psychopathic Dr. Gaul. But Snow’s efforts to save Lucy Gray from death in the arena, based on both his growing feelings and his desperation for success, will push them both to terrible extremes – revealing to Snow who he truly is, and what he’ll do to save himself. In \"The Hunger Games,\" Suzanne Collins depicted District 12 as a painfully impoverished place where starvation was only a missed meal away. And in \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" she depicts a different kind of poverty in the Capitol – it’s a relatively luxurious place full of wealth and parties, but there’s a rotten layer to this crumbling society, a sense of dark decay that underlies Snow’s world. And she reminds us constantly that the Capitol is still scarred by the war between Panem and the rebels, which got so bad that wealthy people cannibalized their servants in the streets. Collins also switches up her writing here – rather than the first-person perspective of the Hunger Games trilogy, she relates Snow’s teenage adventures in the third person. Her prose is tense and taut, with moments of horror (the deaths of some of the tributes) or chilling sadness (“Tell her… that we are all so sorry she has to die”) spattered across it. The plot does grow less intense after the Hunger Games, when it seems like Snow has had to embrace a new life, but then takes a sharp twist into tragedy. And though he’s the protagonist, Coriolanus Snow is never quite a likable person. We know where he’s coming from and what drives him, but he’s still a very chilly, proud, selfish person motivated by a belief that he is genuinely and inherently better than everyone else. When he’s around Lucy Gray, Collins slips in some actual human emotion, which builds up gradually throughout the book… but Collins never lets us forget for long that he’s not a good person, as seen when he talks about killing the mockingjays. And he’s backed by characters who aren’t necessarily what they seem. While there’s the compassionate and slightly melodramatic Sejanus as a counterpoint to Snow’s more amoral approach, Lucy Gray is an elusive, mercurial presence that is hard to nail down. And Dr. Gaul is genuinely scary, a mad scientist who apparently does mad science entirely because she can. There’s a deep sadness at the heart of \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" – a knowledge that this is a story that can’t have a happy ending, and can’t have a hero. But it is a fine dystopian tale, giving greater depth to the history of Panem.",

        "review_text": "I was looking forward to this book and it did not disappoint! You get to understand where Snow comes from and different events that shaped his life. I think Susanne Collins tied in a lot of items from the Hunger Games series very neatly. It's not without a sense of irony that Snow made his position through District 12 and ultimately how he was brought down by the same district that got him there. Without giving away too much of the story, one comes to understand what he had to do to get to the top and what he has to do in order to survive and stay on top. How the war experience shaped his childhood and his family. I do like the image that Susanne Collins conjures up with the \"Snow lands on top\" to describe Snow's conviction in his action, just like Katniss with her \"Fire is catching\" and \"Fire burns/beats rose\". Overall it's satisfying without being predictable. 4.5/5",

I'm a huge fan so I made sure to begin reading at midnight when it was released and then finished it this late morning. I don't want to spoil anything but overall what I liked about this prequel are all of the interconnected pieces from Tigris to the Mockingjay and the history we read about in terms of the formation of the games. The only aspects of this book I did not like were some of the choices in terms of the plotting. DREAM CAST: Snow - Finn Wolfhard Lucy Gray Baird - Sophia Lillis Dr. Gaul - Tilda Swinton (This is the casting that matters the most IMO) The Grandmom - Meryl Streep Sejanus Plinth - Tom Holland Tigris - Zendaya The rest of the cast I'd imagine could be dependent on an open casting call which would be really cool.",

    "full_description": "As President Trump’s National Security Advisor, John Bolton spent many of his 453 days in the room where it happened, and the facts speak for themselves. The result is a White House memoir that is the most comprehensive and substantial account of the Trump Administration, and one of the few to date by a top-level official. With almost daily access to the President, John Bolton has produced a precise rendering of his days in and around the Oval Office. What Bolton saw astonished him: a President for whom getting reelected was the only thing that mattered, even if it meant endangering or weakening the nation. “I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn’t driven by reelection calculations,” he writes. In fact, he argues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trump’s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy—and Bolton documents exactly what those were, and attempts by him and others in the Administration to raise alarms about them. He shows a President addicted to chaos, who embraced our enemies and spurned our friends, and was deeply suspicious of his own government. In Bolton’s telling, all this helped put Trump on the bizarre road to impeachment. “The differences between this presidency and previous ones I had served were stunning,” writes Bolton, who worked for Reagan, Bush 41, and Bush 43. He discovered a President who thought foreign policy is like closing a real estate deal—about personal relationships, made-for-TV showmanship, and advancing his own interests. As a result, the US lost an opportunity to confront its deepening threats, and in cases like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea ended up in a more vulnerable place. Bolton’s account starts with his long march to the West Wing as Trump and others woo him for the National Security job. The minute he lands, he has to deal with Syria’s chemical attack on the city of Douma, and the crises after that never stop. As he writes in the opening pages, “If you don’t like turmoil, uncertainty, and risk—all the while being constantly overwhelmed with information, decisions to be made, and sheer amount of work—and enlivened by international and domestic personality and ego conflicts beyond description, try something else.” The turmoil, conflicts, and egos are all there—from the upheaval in Venezuela, to the erratic and manipulative moves of North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, to the showdowns at the G7 summits, the calculated warmongering by Iran, the crazy plan to bring the Taliban to Camp David, and the placating of an authoritarian China that ultimately exposed the world to its lethal lies. But this seasoned public servant also has a great eye for the Washington inside game, and his story is full of wit and wry humor about how he saw it played.",

Widely heralded as a “masterful” ( Washington Post ) and “essential” ( Slate ) history of the modern American metropolis, Richard Rothstein’s The Color of Law offers “the most forceful argument ever published on how federal, state, and local governments gave rise to and reinforced neighborhood segregation” (William Julius Wilson). Exploding the myth of de facto segregation arising from private prejudice or the unintended consequences of economic forces, Rothstein describes how the American government systematically imposed residential segregation: with undisguised racial zoning; public housing that purposefully segregated previously mixed communities; subsidies for builders to create whites-only suburbs; tax exemptions for institutions that enforced segregation; and support for violent resistance to African Americans in white neighborhoods. A groundbreaking, “virtually indispensable” study that has already transformed our understanding of twentieth-century urban history ( Chicago Daily Observer ), The Color of Law forces us to face the obligation to remedy our unconstitutional past. 13 illustrations",

I grew up one of the all black communities the author talked about. Made up of temporary housing left over the WW2. My Father a returning war vet, tried, again and again, to get a VA loan to get a house the only places where the houses were, the white communities where he watched white vets get their loans and move out years before. Finally my parents saved their money and checked out several places (By then fair housing was the law in California but it did nothing about federal law forbidding financing), they found a white owner not only willing to sell but loaned them part of the down payment (this was in the mid 60's, 20 years after the end of WW2). Not only did that owner catch flack but the other white neighbors were not happy with us moving in, one of whom was an officer...in the German army during the war(so an African-American vet can't move into a neighborhood that a former enemy can - just because he's white?). We were \"lucky\" there was no violence, many neighbors just ostracized us, and a few wanted to buy us out. Other Black families who moved out found them all put into the same block. Imagine in the 60's in an era where there was no internet, faxes, bulletin boards, nor large realtors like Century 21. Realtors were all local, and territorial and yet they all decided to forgo competition and agreed to block place all the black families in one block where they can be \"monitored\". Every time I hear someone spread that myth \"Oh Black people don't want to move into white neighborhoods because they love being among their own\" I straighten them out, African Americans never had a choice!",

        "review_text": "When William Julius Wilson writes that a book is \"the most forceful argument ever published on how federal, state, and local governments gave rise to and reinforced neighborhood segregation,\" it grabs your attention. Rothstein's book is exactly that--a seminal work on the history of housing discrimination that is required reading for anyone who cares about the effect of residential segregation on cities and schools in our country. Rothstein demonstrates that such segregation isn't the result of just or even primarily individual choices, such as \"white flight,\" as has long been popularly understood--what legal experts call \"de facto\" segregation. Instead, with example after example, he proves that housing segregation is the result of decades of explicit government policies--\"de jure\" discrimination--which prevented blacks and whites from living together as a matter of law (not just personal preference) throughout most of the 20th century. In just one of the many examples Rothstein gives, he cites the case of Wallace Stegner, the fiction writer, who was recruited to teach at Stanford immediately after WWII. Housing was scarce across the country during this post-war period. Stegner and friends formed a cooperative to purchase a 260-acre ranch in Palo Alto in which they planned to build 400 affordable homes for low-paid professors and other working-class families. The co-op had 150 members, three of whom were black. But as part of its official policy, the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) wouldn't insure loans to a cooperative or development that included black residents. And no bank would issue a loan or a mortgage to any builder or developer without this government backing. Thus, the cooperative was effectively barred from creating integrated housing--even when its members wanted it! Their \"choice,\" in fact, wasn't a choice--but was the result of \"de jure\" discrimination. Because the Veterans' Administration also relied on FHA rules for underwriting, black servicemen were similarly barred from receiving the same VA loans for housing that white vets enjoyed. As Rothstein shows, such practices weren't just characteristic of the Jim Crow south, but occurred in every metropolitan area and region of the country. As a result, blacks were barred from participating in the post-war housing boom and the wealth this boom created for the generations that followed, resulting in the wealth discrepancy that is still evident today. These government policies also effectively combined to prevent blacks from working at better jobs (located far from where they were allowed to live) or attending better schools. Instead, blacks were frequently confined to rental apartments, which actually cost more than comparable housing would cost in white neighborhoods, further eroding any economic gains blacks might make. As Rothstein shows, in the rare instances that African Americans did manage to buy housing in white neighborhoods, they typically encountered racial violence to drive them from their homes; such violence was tolerated or even encouraged by local authorities. As Rothstein shows, school boards similarly promoted segregated housing as official policy. At every turn, for decade after decade, it was virtually impossible for blacks to improve their station by moving into middle-class neighborhoods where whites also lived and where economic and educational opportunities congregated. Such policies, although clearly unconstitutional, persisted throughout most of the 20th century, Rothstein writes, and continue to have a profound influence on the prospects for blacks today. Even the conservative justices of the Supreme Court have acknowledged that \"de jure\" discrimination must be remedied. It is thus Rothstein's conclusion that we must acknowledge and address the effects of this injustice, whose discriminatory impact is ongoing. Along with Matthew Desmond's book \"Evicted,\" Rothstein's \"The Color of Law\" demands a radical rethinking of how we conceive of segregation--and how to address it.",

These practices have disproportionately affected African Americans, keeping their communities poor and leading to the creation of segregated neighbourhoods, where none previously existed. The most disconcerting thing about this is that it the policies have been supported by the state and federal government. Not just in the Southern States, but throughout the US. Also, whilst these 'racial' discriminatory practices are no longer openly applied, their effects have carried over into the lives of the children, grandchildren, and other generations of African American families, also keeping them in poverty. This is another excellent and well-researched history of discriminatory practices in the US, showing that despite the idea of the \"American Dream\", where anyone can achieve whatever they want, inequality has been and continues to be a feature of US society.",

Is this self-segregation a problem to address or a coping strategy? Beverly Daniel Tatum, a renowned authority on the psychology of racism, argues that straight talk about our racial identities is essential if we are serious about enabling communication across racial and ethnic divides. These topics have only become more urgent as the national conversation about race is increasingly acrimonious. This fully revised edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the dynamics of race in America.",

The author is a secular author, but there is still value in reading the book for Christians. If you are committed to becoming a “change agent” in your own heart and the community around you as it relates to racial and discrimination issues, this book will be helpful. You may not agree with her examples of why racism is a hot issue in our country (e.g., the election of Pres. Trump, the imprisonment of a high percentage of black people, etc.) but you will still benefit from hearing her reasoning, because our first objective in being “change agents” should be to understand one another. I read this book to understand a segment of our society that sees racism as a bigger issue than I do. The book came recommended to me by numerous people, and the author cities thousands of authors, studies and other articles – thus, this book represents a fair representation of one of the primary sides on the issue of racism in our country. After reading her book, I agree with her last paragraph where she wrote, “Is it better? My answer is: Not yet, but it could be. It’s up to us to make sure it is. I remain hopeful.”",

The author uses many examples from her long teaching career to make her points, which is going to be very hard for some readers. This is NOT A GOOD BOOK TO START WITH if you are just beginning to explore white/black or dominant culture versus minority relations issues. Readers who are less informed will inevitably do the \"but not me\" \"that's not how I think\" dance when reading examples and will be too defensive to get much of anything out of this book.

If you interact with children in ANY way (parent, family member, social worker, teacher, coach, babysitter, nanny, pastor, etc.), I HIGHLY recommend you read this book. It not only talks about race/identity of young black people, but it also delves into the identities of Whites, Latins, Middle Eastern/North Africans, Asians, Native (American) Indians, Asian Indians, biracial children, and transracial adopted children (a family of adopting a child of a different race).

It includes chapters on Black racial identity development in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, which I have found extremely insightful and practical. Dr. Tatum brings in examples from raising her own sons and tidbits of the conversations she had with them, modeling parent-child interactions around race for parents who may be faced with similar problems. Another part that I found very useful is the discussion of Affirmative Action and some arguments against it that are frequently brought up. That section helped me articulate my own position better and be more prepared for times when such conversations arise spontaneously with students or colleagues. Overall, this is a classic and a highly recommended read for anyone interested in issues of social justice, equal opportunity, democracy, and the psychological underpinnings of prejudice.",
